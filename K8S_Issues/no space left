Repro:
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "500m"
        cpu: "250m"
      limits:
        memory: "600m"
        cpu: "500m"


RCA:
Limits and requests for memory are measured in bytes. You can express memory as a plain integer or as a fixed-point number using one of these quantity suffixes: E, P, T, G, M, k. You can also use the power-of-two equivalents: Ei, Pi, Ti, Gi, Mi, Ki. For example, the following represent roughly the same value:
128974848, 129e6, 129M,  128974848000m, 123Mi

Mitigation:
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "500M"
        cpu: "250m"
      limits:
        memory: "600M"
        cpu: "500m"
